# Use the german_credit_data.csv file to complete the following assignment.
# Create a file, german.py, that loads the .csv file and runs a regression predicting
# credit amount from age and duration, in that order. Add a constant using sm.add_constant(data).
# You will need to rename the column 'Credit amount' and should change
# it to 'Credit_amount'. Note: you will not need to upload the .csv to CodeGrade
# because I have pre-loaded it. Then, print the parameters and R-squared to 2 decimals using
