# IMPORTANT
# Your autotest cases will NOT work if you don’t load your sys.argv like below. For this assignment, load in your sys.argv like so:
duck_goose = sys.argv[1:]
# The above duck_goose a list-type variable which contains lower-cased words, either 'duck' or 'goose' (ex. [ 'duck', 'duck', 'goose']).
# Create a program, which removes all the ‘goose’ within the list then print the remaining list.
# Example - If the list is ['goose', 'duck', 'duck', 'goose', 'goose'], the program should print:
#       ['duck', 'duck']
