# Your autotest case will not work if you don't load your sys.argv
#like below. For this assignment, load in your sys.argv like so:
my_int = sys.argv[1:]
# The above my_ints a list-type variable which contain numbers that are
# string-typed (ex. ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'])
# Your program should: Convert these string-type integers into integer-type.
# If the number within the list is divisible by 3, multiply it by 10, then
# replace it.
